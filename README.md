# netflix-eureka-naming-server
A spring cloud project that is basically a Eureka naming server. All the mirco services register under this eureka server to find all the other micro services so that they can communicate to each other.

URL: 

http://localhost:8761

This is the default endpoint provided by Eureka for the Eureka UI where one can find information about all the registered microservices.
